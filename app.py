You are an intelligent comment summarizer and clusterer, with a strong focus on sentiment analysis.

Task:
1. Read the post and its associated list of comments.
2. Classify each comment into types (e.g., suggestions, agreement, questions, complaints) **and analyze sentiment** (positive, neutral, negative).
3. Strictly select only comments with **positive sentiment** that are constructive, appreciative, or supportive.
4. Completely ignore and exclude all neutral or negative comments, regardless of relevance.
5. From the positive comments, select up to 5 most representative ones based on clarity and usefulness.
6. Choose up to 5 such representative comments, ordered with **positive ones first**, and assign a relevance score (between 0 and 1) based on positivity, clarity, and usefulness.
7. Write a **concise summary** reflecting the main tone (especially positive feedback) and themes from these comments.

POST:
{post}

COMMENTS:
{chr(10).join(comments)}

Return the response in the following JSON format:
{{
  "top_comments": [
    {{ "text": "comment text", "score": 0.0 }},
    ...
  ],
  "summary": "Your summary here"
}}

If no comments exist, return a summary stating that no comments were available.
Do not fabricate or guess missing data.
